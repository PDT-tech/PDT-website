## Project Summary ← paste this into any new session

We are hand-coding a website for **Portland DayTime Singers (PDT Singers)**, a men's
barbershop-style chorus in Portland, Oregon that performs free concerts for seniors in
care facilities and recruits male singers. PDT Singers is **Lodge #18 of the Worldwide
Barbershop Quartet Association (WBQA)**, co-founded by director **Chris Gabel** and
**Kevin Bier** (Grand Poohbah). NOT affiliated with BHS — state clearly on About page.

**Domain:** pdtsingers.org (helpinghosting.com). Current placeholder at GreenGeeks to
be retired at DNS cutover when new site launches.

**Tech stack:**
- Hand-coded HTML5 / CSS3 / vanilla JS — no frameworks, no WordPress
- Hosted on **Netlify** (free tier) — GitHub CI/CD deploy
- Auth via **Supabase** (magic link via Resend SMTP, admin controls access via is_active flag, member content storage)
- Forms via **Netlify Forms**
- **Netlify Functions** (serverless) — Drive proxy for Music Library
- Source control on **GitHub**: https://github.com/kevin36v/PDT-website
- Email via **Google Workspace for Nonprofits** (TechSoup verification pending)

**Owner/maintainer:** Kevin Bier — experienced software/product exec (C++, 25+ yrs
product leadership at HP/Microsoft/Nike), light on DB and web coding, fully capable of
technical lifting with guidance.

**Design:** Palette from PDT logo watercolor wash (sky blues + cream + forest dark +
gold). Fonts: Playfair Display + Source Serif 4. Tone: warm, community-focused,
first-person plural. Tagline: "Music, Fellowship & Fun."

**Current phase:** Phase 2 active — all public pages live with real content. Member accounts seeded. Issue tracker migrated to pdt-issues.md (CC-owned). Decision log established as pdt-decisions.md.

## Key Decisions Log

Decisions have been migrated to **`pdt-decisions.md`** (repo root, also in Project Memory). That file is the authoritative record with full rationale. CC never modifies it. Update it in chat and re-upload to Project Memory when new decisions are made.

---

## Document Reconciliation (Sunday evenings)

Living docs (.md files) are updated throughout the week by CC. The .html versions
are reconciled once per week — Sunday evenings only.

**Workflow for the Sunday reconciliation chat:**
1. Ask CC to `cat pdt-tech-maintainers-guide.md`
2. Find all lines matching `<!-- html-synced: ... -->`
3. Any .md change made AFTER the most recent `html-synced` marker is the delta
   to carry into the .html
4. After reconciling, CC adds a new `<!-- html-synced: YYYY-MM-DD -->` marker
   and commits both files

**Scope:** Currently applies to `pdt-tech-maintainers-guide` only. If other .md/.html
pairs are added, list them here.

---

## Netlify Environment Variables (all 5 set)

| Key | What it is |
|-----|-----------|
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase project URL |
| `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase publishable anon key |
| `GOOGLE_DRIVE_API_KEY` | Drive API key (used for local dev direct calls) |
| `GOOGLE_DRIVE_MUSIC_FOLDER_ID` | ID of the Music folder in Drive |
| `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` | Full service account JSON (secret); used by Netlify Function in production |

---

## Key Learnings & Principles

- **Newsletter / one-pager pipeline:** Create as HTML using PDT design tokens. Kevin opens in Chromium, Cmd+P → Save as PDF, Margins: None, Background graphics checked. No sandbox PDF rendering — wkhtmltopdf and LibreOffice both mangle CSS grid and gradients.
- **Netlify auto-publish is permanently locked.** Kevin always manually publishes. Never remind him to lock it — it is never unlocked.

---

## Notes & Gotchas

- PDT Singers is **NOT BHS** — must be stated on About page; some visitors will assume BHS affiliation
- **Three member blogs**: Director's Notes (musical_director + admin), Prattling from the Grand Poohbah (admin only), Events blog (events_editor + admin)
- **Roles**: admin (Kevin), musical_director (Chris), events_editor (social media mgr/Wives Auxiliary/etc.), calendar_manager, member
- **Music Library**: Drive is source of truth — no Supabase songs table. Production calls Netlify Function which uses service account JWT auth. Local dev calls Drive API directly with API key (requires Music folder temporarily set to "Anyone with link" — don't forget to revert).
- **Service account key security**: original key was exposed in chat during Session 3 and immediately rotated. New key is in repo root (gitignored) and in Netlify env vars.
- **inject-env.js**: now injects all 4 PDT env vars (Supabase + Drive). Edge function is safe to commit — no hardcoded values.
- Duane Lundsten (Poohbah of Complex Stuff) passed March 2026 — memorial placeholder in design; no action before Phase 1
- WBQA lodge list page is nearly empty — no central directory driving traffic to lodge sites; PDT SEO work is important
- Supabase free tier is generous but has a 1-week inactivity pause policy — member activity should prevent this
- Netlify Forms free tier: 100 submissions/month — more than sufficient for this site
- Netlify Functions free tier: 125k invocations/month — Music Library uses ~30/day max
- Google Workspace nonprofit application takes 2–4 weeks via TechSoup after IRS letter in hand
- Director's name is **Gabel** (German spelling) — confirmed by Kevin. Earlier comp had "Gable" which was the typo.
- **Local dev**: `cd ~/PDT-website && python3 -m http.server 8080` — keep browser dev tools open with cache disabled
- **env.local.js**: gitignored local file that sets window.__PDT_ENV with all 4 credentials. Must be present in repo root for local dev. Never commit.
- **Role visibility pattern**: use `applyRoleVisibility()` checking `window.__PDT_USER` directly, falling back to `pdt:profile-loaded` event — direct event listener alone has a timing race condition
- **Supabase posts RLS policies**: insert/update/delete are role+blog_type scoped; select has two policies — `posts_select_authenticated` (published only, all members) + `posts_select_admin` (all posts, admin only) + `posts_select_author` (own posts, any role)
- **pdtsingers.music@gmail.com**: created as staging account but not used — Music files live in Workspace Drive. May dispose of this account.
